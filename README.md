# Analysis of DCM struc in SPM 
A community-fed documentation for the DCM structs available on SPM12

**Abbreviations and resources:**
- SPM: Statistical Parametric Mapping
    - [SPM on Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/SPM)
- DCM: Dynamic Causal Modeling
    - If you are not familiar with this concept, consider reading [this article on Scholarpedia](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamic_causal_modeling)
- EEG: Electroencephalography/Electroencephalogram
    - [EEG on Scholarpedia](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Electroencephalography)
    - [Functional imaging on Scholarpedia](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Functional_imaging)
- fMRI: functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    - [fMRI on Scholarpedia](http://scholarpedia.org/article/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging)
- NMM: Neural mass model
- MFM: Mean Field model
- NMDA: N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid. Often, you will see NMDA alone in the documentation. However, what is usually meant is the NMDA receptor
    - The Morris-Lecar model was expanded in 2010 to include NMDA ion channels in pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. For details, please consult the paper by [Moran _et al_, 2010](https://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/ext/rd/RD_Consistent_2011.pdf)
- CMC: canonical microcircuit
